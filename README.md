# Password-Generator

# Understanding
Going through this assignment has definitely been the most difficult for me so far. I regrettably did not get the sight to work and I could not figure out how to achieve that. I experimented with quite a few methods, searched a lot through Google and I am aware that it was my lack of understanding for JavaScript that caused this.

*I will get this right, I just need more to experiment with JavaScript because so far, it has been more of a struggle to understand in comparison to HTML and CSS for me. But I do understand that as for this assignment I did not meet the requirements for completion.

# Thought-Process
The following is what I had in mind to do but could not figure out how to do it exactly.
 - List the variables that can be used in the generated password.
 - Add WindowPrompts asking the user how many characters, uppercase letters, and special characters they would like in their password.
 - Find a way to save that information to use in order to generate the password (this is where I struggled the most).
 - Create a function for generate password.
 - Add an event listener for the generate button.

# Other-Ideas
If I were for example, to add checkboxes to the HTML code with the variables there, instead of trying to do the window prompts, I think I would've been able to do better with that because I understand it more than I do Javascript at the moment. But I understand the benefits of JS, and I definitely do want to improve.
